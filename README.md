# dream-spots

### what i used

i used html for the main code
and css to clean it up

**Intro**
I would like to put more spots that are outside and change the background to a warmer color
so it feels like you are there.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
